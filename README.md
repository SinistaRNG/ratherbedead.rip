# ratherbedead.rip

Bootstrap site currently live at ratherbedead.rip. Not much has changed since the days of the site first existing as a [Github Pages](https://github.com/SinistaRNG/hurr) site. 

As was commonplace back then, whatever I tell you is actually here and hosted correctly probably isn't right.

Basic template grabbed from [here](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/grayscale/) with very few modifications made by myself for my own personal use.

### TODOs:
- [x] Grab website from server and host it back on Git
- [ ] Add TODO section on playlist.html
- [x] Fix background scaling on devices with displays less than 1080p
- [ ] Updating contact portion of the main page to include additional social media links

### Nice to haves:
- [ ] Additional features on the website
- [ ] Hosted Discord bot
- [ ] Smalled scaled background images for smaller resolutions
- [ ] Creating own assets for media buttons
